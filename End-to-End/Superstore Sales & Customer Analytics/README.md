## Workflow  

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Fixed datatypes, standardized column names  
   - Checked for nulls & duplicates (none found)  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - **Univariate Analysis** 
   - **Bivariate Analysis** 
   - Each of the analysis includes Data & Business Insights along with Recommendations. 

3. **Time Series Forecasting (Prophet)**  
   - Predicted **next 6 months sales**  
   - Found **seasonality & cyclic trends**  
     - Q4 & early Q1 â†’ strong spikes (holiday/New Year)  
     - Q2 dip â†’ recovery in April, followed by slowdown in Q2â€“Q3  

4. **RFM Customer Segmentation**  
   - Segmented customers into:  
     - **High Value (39.6%)** â€“ Loyal & high spenders  
     - **Mid Value (35.7%)** â€“ Potential to be upgraded  
     - **Low Value (24.7%)** â€“ Least engaged, risk of churn  

5. **SQL KPI Extraction**  
   - Queried important KPIs such as:  
     - Average Order Value (AOV)  
     - Overall Profit Margin
     - Top 5 Products by Profit
     - Total Sales vs Total Profit by Region 
     - Total Sales by Category and Sub-Category 
     - Yearly Profit and YoY Growth 
     - Monthly sales by Year
     - Average Profit by Discount Range
     - Profit Contribution(%) by Category
   - Integrated into a **Power BI Dashboard**

## Key Insights  

- **Profitability Volatility** â†’ High profits & heavy losses exist across shipping modes, categories, and discounts.  
- **Seasonality Matters** â†’ Sales peak in Q4 (holidays) and recover every April, but slow down in mid-year.  
- **Customer Engagement** â†’ Nearly 40% high-value customers, but ~25% low-value segment shows disengagement risk.  
- **Discounts > 20%** â†’ Often lead to losses, suggesting pricing policy revision is needed.  
- **Regional Nuance** â†’ West & East drive most sales, but South underperforms and needs marketing focus.

## Recommendations  

1. **Seasonal Planning**  
   - Stock up & strengthen logistics for Q4 & Janâ€“Apr peaks.  
   - Introduce loyalty rewards during off-season dips.  

2. **Pricing & Discount Policy**
