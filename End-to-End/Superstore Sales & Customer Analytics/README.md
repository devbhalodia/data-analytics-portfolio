## Data Source  
The dataset used is the **Superstore Dataset** from Kaggle:  
🔗 [Superstore Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final)  

Each row represents a **unique customer transaction**, containing details such as:

- Product purchased  
- Quantity & Discount  
- Sales value & Profit  
- Customer information  
- Shipping mode, Segment, Region

## Workflow  

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Fixed datatypes, standardized column names  
   - Checked for nulls & duplicates (none found)  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - **Univariate Analysis** 
   - **Bivariate Analysis** 
   - Each of the analysis includes Data & Business Insights along with Recommendations. 

3. **Time Series Forecasting (Prophet)**  
   - Predicted **next 6 months sales**  
   - Found **seasonality & cyclic trends**  
     - Q4 & early Q1 → strong spikes (holiday/New Year)  
     - Q2 dip → recovery in April, followed by slowdown in Q2–Q3  

4. **RFM Customer Segmentation**  
   - Segmented customers into:  
     - **High Value (39.6%)** – Loyal & high spenders  
     - **Mid Value (35.7%)** – Potential to be upgraded  
     - **Low Value (24.7%)** – Least engaged, risk of churn  

5. **SQL KPI Extraction**  
   - Queried important KPIs such as:  
     - Average Order Value (AOV)  
     - Overall Profit Margin
     - Top 5 Products by Profit
     - Total Sales vs Total Profit by Region 
     - Total Sales by Category and Sub-Category 
     - Yearly Profit and YoY Growth 
     - Monthly sales by Year
     - Average Profit by Discount Range
     - Profit Contribution(%) by Category
   - Integrated into a **Power BI Dashboard**

## Key Insights  

- **Profitability Volatility** → High profits & heavy losses exist across shipping modes, categories, and discounts.  
- **Seasonality Matters** → Sales peak in Q4 (holidays) and recover every April, but slow down in mid-year.  
- **Customer Engagement** → Nearly 40% high-value customers, but ~25% low-value segment shows disengagement risk.  
- **Discounts > 20%** → Often lead to losses, suggesting pricing policy revision is needed.  
- **Regional Nuance** → West & East drive most sales, but South underperforms and needs marketing focus.

## Recommendations  

1. **Seasonal Planning**  
   - Stock up & strengthen logistics for Q4 & Jan–Apr peaks.  
   - Introduce loyalty rewards during off-season dips.  

2. **Pricing & Discount Policy**  
   - Avoid excessive discounts (>20%) to protect margins.  
   - Revisit discount structure for bulk buyers & low-margin categories.  

3. **Customer Strategy**  
   - High Value → retain with loyalty programs  
   - Mid Value → targeted marketing to upgrade them  
   - Low Value → retention offers, reminders, and engagement campaigns  

4. **Regional Focus**  
   - Push marketing & discounts in the **South region** to boost engagement.
